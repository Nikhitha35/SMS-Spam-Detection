# SMS-Spam-Detection
SMS Spam Detection â€“ Advanced Data Science Project
Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF, Machine Learning

Designed and implemented a machine learning-based SMS spam detection system.
Applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform textual data into feature vectors.
Built and compared multiple models: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, F1-score for spam and ham classes, and visualized results with comparison plots.
Optimized hyperparameters and selected the best-performing model for final deployment.
Implemented a modular and reusable pipeline for data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.
Saved trained models and vectorizers using Pickle for future use.
